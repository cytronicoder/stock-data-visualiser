# Stock Data Visualiser

This is a simple stock data visualiser that uses the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) to get stock data. I built this to learn more about data crunching and visualisation, and this is my final project for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x).

The aim of this project is to build a fully functional LSTM model that predicts future stock prices based on historical prices using PyTorch. It is currently in development, and I will be adding more features as I learn more about data visualisation.
